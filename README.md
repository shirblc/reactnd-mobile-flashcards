# Mobile Flashcards

## Description

Mobile Flashcards is an app made especially for students preparing for tests. You can use it to write down questions and answers about the material, organise these questions in groups and even get quizzed about each group. Ready? Set. Study!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/expo/create-react-native-app).

## Requirements

- Node.js
- Expo mobile app or iOS/Android simulator

## Installaton and Usage

1. Download or clone the repo.
2. cd into the project directory.
3. Run ```npm install``` and ```npm install -g expo-cli``` to install dependencies.
4. If you're going to run the app on your phone, download the Expo app. If you intend to run the app on a simulator, you'll need to install it before running the app. For more information about either option, check the [official Expo docs](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/).
5. Run ```expo start``` to start the server.
6. With the server running, scan the QR on your device (remember to make sure you're using the same network as your computer). This should start the Expo app, running Mobile Flashcards. 
7. Add cards, get quizzed, and enjoy the app!
